## Unit Economics

### Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)

**Channels**:
1. **Direct outreach**: $0 (founder-led)
2. **Content marketing**: $500/customer
3. **Partnerships**: $1,000/customer
4. **Paid ads**: $2,000/customer

**Blended CAC**: $2,000 per customer

### Lifetime Value (LTV)

**Assumptions**:
- Average customer lifetime: 3 years
- Average transaction volume: $500K/year
- Revenue per customer: $2,500/year (0.5% of volume)
- Gross margin: 75%

**Calculation**:
\`\`\`
LTV = (Annual Revenue Ã— Gross Margin Ã— Customer Lifetime)
LTV = ($2,500 Ã— 0.75 Ã— 3 years)
LTV = $5,625 per customer
\`\`\`

**With subscriptions**:
\`\`\`
Transaction revenue: $2,500/year
Subscription revenue: $500/year
Total: $3,000/year
LTV = ($3,000 Ã— 0.75 Ã— 3) = $6,750
\`\`\`

### LTV:CAC Ratio

\`\`\`
LTV:CAC = $6,750 / $2,000 = 3.4:1
\`\`\`

**Benchmark**: Healthy SaaS is 3:1 or higher âœ“
