### 1.2 Create Waitlist Table

1. In your Supabase project, click "SQL Editor" in left sidebar
2. Click "New Query"
3. Copy the contents of `scripts/create-waitlist-table.sql`
4. Paste into the SQL editor
5. Click "Run" button

### 1.3 Get API Keys

1. Click "Settings" (gear icon) in left sidebar
2. Click "API" under Project Settings
3. Copy these values (you'll need them next):

\`\`\`

Replace the values with your actual Supabase credentials from Step 1.3.
